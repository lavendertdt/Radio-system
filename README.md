# Ratio System

## Requirements

- python 3.5 (or higher)
- *requests*, if you want to run `client.py`.

## Server

Just run:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

That will launch a server on *localhost*, with port *8765*. You can use command line option `--port=PORT` to specify a difference port.

## Client Test

Try:

```bash
python3 client.py
```

You will find that the server runs good.
